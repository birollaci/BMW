Your task is to implement a REST endpoint testing software in java 8+. Any other framework or technology can be used. The suggested database is PostgreSQL.
 
Your code has to call the following endpoint, and handle all the data you will get back in the response.
https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users
 
- Store the users and the data connected to them in a database
- Check if it was a successful http call and you get back the response correctly (same count of users every time and 200 OK http status)
- Create a log file automatically which contains the details of the api calls and the response statuses. 
- Validate all the user emails (text@text.tld)
During your work use git (Github, Gitlab or Bitbucket) for version control.
Attach a proper readme file to your finished project.
